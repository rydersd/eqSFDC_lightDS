            <h3>Three-Column Layout Best Practices</h3>
            <p>Lightning record pages support three regions (left, center, right). Salesforce provides the three-column template in App Builder but does not prescribe which content belongs in which column — that decision is left to each org. Common patterns include Details&nbsp;left / Activity&nbsp;center / Related&nbsp;right, as well as Related&nbsp;left / Details&nbsp;center / Activity&nbsp;right. The EQ Lightning prototype uses the latter, giving the record detail the widest (flex) column for readability while keeping related lists and activity in fixed-width rails.</p>

            <h3>Highlights Panel and Compact Layouts</h3>
            <p>The highlights panel appears at the top of every record page and shows 5-8 key fields from the compact layout. This serves as the "right record?" confirmation — users should be able to identify the record within 3 seconds. Salesforce recommends keeping compact layouts to the most essential identification fields.</p>

        <div class="eq-research-card">
            <h3>Dynamic Forms and Conditional Visibility</h3>
            <p>Dynamic Forms allow individual fields and sections to be placed anywhere on the record page (not just in the record detail component). Combined with visibility rules, fields can show/hide based on record type, user profile, or field values — enabling role-aware layouts without multiple page assignments.</p>

            <h3>Path Component for Lifecycle Stages</h3>
            <p>The Path component displays the sales process or support lifecycle as a chevron diagram at the top of record pages. It provides guidance text at each stage, helping users understand what actions to take. Works best on Opportunity (Sales Path), Case (Support Path), and Order (Fulfillment Path).</p>

            <h3>Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS)</h3>
            <p>SLDS provides the CSS framework and component blueprints for building consistent Lightning interfaces. The current version (2.28.x) includes form elements, cards, data tables, modals, and layout utilities. All components follow WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.</p>

        <div class="eq-research-card">
            <h3>SLDS Form Element Patterns</h3>
            <p>Record detail fields use the SLDS form element pattern with horizontal labels (label left, value right) or stacked labels (label above value). For record pages with many fields, the stacked pattern with a two-column grid provides the best density without sacrificing readability.</p>

        <div class="eq-research-card">
            <h3>SLDS Card Component</h3>
            <p>Cards are the primary container for grouped content on record pages — used for related lists, Agentforce insights, and custom components. Each card has a header, body, and optional footer. Cards stack vertically within their column.</p>

            <h3>Salesforce Operating, Governance &amp; Architecture Framework (SOGAF)</h3>
            <p>Large Salesforce deployments benefit from formal governance frameworks. SOGAF provides structure for managing change across multiple business units, establishing object ownership, and standardizing page layouts across teams. Key to preventing the "800+ objects" sprawl that Equinix experienced.</p>

        <div class="eq-research-card">
            <h3>Change Management for Lightning Migrations</h3>
            <p>Salesforce recommends a phased rollout approach: pilot with power users, gather feedback, iterate on layouts, then expand. Training should focus on "where to look" (the consistent three-column pattern) rather than feature-by-feature walkthroughs.</p>

            <h3>Coexistence with Legacy Systems</h3>
            <p>The "swivel chair" problem — users switching between Salesforce, Siebel, and email — is common in enterprise environments. Reducing system switches is a primary driver of Salesforce standardization. The goal: make Salesforce the single pane of glass so users don't need to leave.</p>

            <h3>Agentforce Overview</h3>
            <p>Agentforce brings AI agents directly into Lightning record pages. Agents can summarize account intelligence, draft customer outreach, suggest case resolutions, and auto-populate fields from quotes. Each agent action is tied to a specific record context and can be placed as a component on the page layout.</p>

        <div class="eq-research-card">
            <h3>Where Agentforce Fits in the Assembly Pattern</h3>
            <p>In the three-column layout, Agentforce components appear in context-appropriate positions: intelligence/insights in the left column (near detail fields), action-oriented agents in the center column (near activity timeline), and engagement analytics in the right column (near related lists). This placement ensures AI assistance is discoverable without disrupting the standard flow.</p>
